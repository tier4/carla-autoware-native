CARLA with RobotecGPULidar (RGL)
================================

This document describes how to build and run CARLA with
[RobotecGPULidar (RGL)](https://github.com/RobotecAI/RobotecGPULidar) — a
GPU-accelerated ray-traced LiDAR simulation library. The setup is driven by
`RglSetup.sh`, which complements the standard `CarlaSetup.sh` flow with the
steps required to clone, build and integrate RGL and its dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
> RGL integration requires an NVIDIA GPU, CUDA, NVIDIA OptiX SDK 7.2 and
> ROS 2 Humble on the host machine. The GPU LiDAR pipeline also uses the
> `RclcppBridge` helper library under
> `Unreal/CarlaUnreal/Plugins/CarlaRGL/ThirdParty/RclcppBridge` to coordinate
> rclcpp/DDS domain ownership between CARLA and RGL.

## Recommended system

* Intel i7 gen 9th - 11th / Intel i9 gen 9th - 11th / AMD Ryzen 7 / AMD Ryzen 9
* +32 GB RAM
* NVIDIA RTX 3070 / 3080 / 3090 / RTX 4090 / RTX 5090 or better
* 16 GB or more VRAM
* Ubuntu 22.04 (Ubuntu 24.04 not yet verified)
* CUDA Toolkit (tested with 12.x)
* NVIDIA OptiX SDK 7.2
* ROS 2 Humble

> [!NOTE]
> Windows is not yet supported by `RglSetup.sh` — **TBD**.

## Workflow overview

RGL integration uses a three-step workflow. `CarlaSetup.sh` is run between
the two `RglSetup.sh` invocations:

```
1. bash RglSetup.sh prepare [OPTIONS]   # Check prerequisites, clone+build RGL
2. bash CarlaSetup.sh -i                # Standard CARLA setup
3. bash RglSetup.sh build  [OPTIONS]    # Reconfigure CARLA with RGL, rebuild
```

Step 1 stages the RGL library and its colcon-built dependencies
(`agnocast`, `radar_msgs`, …). Step 2 runs the standard CARLA setup (Unreal
Engine download, content, initial build). Step 3 reconfigures CMake with
`ENABLE_RGL=ON` and rebuilds CARLA so that the CarlaRGL plugin is linked in.

## Building CARLA with RGL

### Step 1 — `prepare`

Run from the CARLA root directory (`CarlaUE5/`):

```sh
cd CarlaUE5
bash RglSetup.sh prepare --optix-dir=/path/to/NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.2.0-linux64-x86_64
```

What it does:

1. Verifies CUDA, OptiX SDK, ROS 2 Humble and `patchelf` are available.
2. Clones `RobotecGPULidar/` alongside `CarlaUE5/` (git branch: `develop`).
3. Sources `/opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` and installs RGL core, PCL, ROS 2 and
   Agnocast dependencies via `python3 setup.py --install-*-deps`.
4. Builds RGL with the selected extensions and produces
   `RobotecGPULidar/build/lib/libRobotecGPULidar.so`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also set `OptiX_INSTALL_DIR` in the environment instead of passing
> `--optix-dir=`.

### Step 2 — `CarlaSetup.sh`

Run the standard CARLA setup to download Unreal Engine 5, content and
produce a first CARLA build:

```sh
bash CarlaSetup.sh -i
```

See [README.md](README.md) for full `CarlaSetup.sh` usage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **not** use `CarlaSetup.sh -l` here — it launches the editor *without*
> RGL. RGL is only enabled after Step 3.

### Step 3 — `build`

Reconfigure CMake with `ENABLE_RGL=ON` and rebuild:

```sh
bash RglSetup.sh build                       # rebuild only
bash RglSetup.sh build --package=shipping    # + build Shipping package
bash RglSetup.sh build --package=development # + build Development package
bash RglSetup.sh build --package=launch      # + open UE5 editor with RGL
```

The script:

1. Detects and wipes stale CMake caches under `Build/` (see
   [Stale cache detection](#stale-cache-detection)).
2. Runs `cmake -G Ninja -S . -B Build --toolchain=$PWD/CMake/Toolchain.cmake
   -DENABLE_ROS2=ON -DENABLE_RGL=ON -DCARLA_DDS_VENDOR=CycloneDDS …`.
3. Invokes `cmake --build Build` and, if requested, the package target.

`RclcppBridge` is built as an ExternalProject under `Build/` using the system
compiler (not the UE toolchain), linking against `rclcpp` from
`/opt/ros/humble`.

## Rebuilding CARLA (manual)

Once `RglSetup.sh build` has succeeded once, subsequent builds can be done
with the standard CMake commands:

```sh
export CARLA_UNREAL_ENGINE_PATH=$(realpath ../UnrealEngine5_carla)
cmake --build Build                              # rebuild
cmake --build Build --target package             # Shipping package
cmake --build Build --target package-development # Development package
cmake --build Build --target launch              # UE5 editor
```

## Running a packaged build

```sh
cd Build/Package/Carla-*-Linux-Shipping/Linux
./CarlaUnreal.sh --ros2
```

## Command reference

### `prepare` options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--optix-dir=PATH`       | OptiX SDK path (or set `OptiX_INSTALL_DIR`) |
| `--rgl-branch=BRANCH`    | RGL git branch (default: `develop`) |
| `--rgl-repo=URL`         | RGL git repository URL |
| `--skip-rgl-build`       | Skip RGL build (use pre-built library) |
| `--no-pcl`               | Disable PCL extension |
| `--no-ros2-standalone`   | Disable ROS 2 standalone extension |
| `--no-agnocast`          | Disable Agnocast extension |
| `--with-weather`         | Enable weather extension (private repo) |
| `--with-udp`             | Enable UDP extension (private repo) |

### `build` options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--package=shipping`    | Build the CARLA Shipping package after rebuild |
| `--package=development` | Build the CARLA Development package after rebuild |
| `--package=launch`      | Launch the UE5 editor after rebuild |
| `--package=none`        | (default) Rebuild only, no package step |

## Stale cache detection

`RglSetup.sh` detects three classes of stale build artifacts that arise when
the workspace is renamed, copied, or when `SOURCE_DIR` changes in CMake:

| Detector | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `verify_cmake_cache_path`              | top-level `CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY` mismatch | wipe `build_dir` |
| `verify_cmake_subcache_sources_exist`  | ExternalProject sub-cache points to a missing directory | wipe the affected sub-build only |
| `verify_colcon_install_path`           | colcon `setup.sh` has a baked-in path from a previous workspace | wipe `build/`, `install/`, `log/` |

These are invoked automatically:

- `prepare`: scans `RobotecGPULidar/build/` and every colcon workspace under
  `RobotecGPULidar/external/*/` and `RobotecGPULidar/extensions/*/`.
- `build`:  scans `CarlaUE5/Build/` and every ExternalProject sub-cache
  underneath it.

No flags are needed — relocating the workspace is handled transparently.

## Package compression

### When compression runs

Whether the `package*` target compresses the staged build is controlled by the
upstream `CARLA_UNREAL_PACKAGE_NO_COMPRESSION` option. Its default depends on
the build type (inherited from upstream CARLA, not RGL-specific):

| `CARLA_UNREAL_PACKAGE_BUILD_TYPE` | `NO_COMPRESSION` default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `Shipping`       | `OFF` | Compression runs |
| others (Development, Debug, …) | `ON`  | Compression is skipped |

Override with `-DCARLA_UNREAL_PACKAGE_NO_COMPRESSION=ON|OFF`.

### Compression method

When compression runs, the method is selectable via `CARLA_PACKAGE_COMPRESSION`
(default: `pigz` — parallel gzip, auto-detects CPU cores):

```sh
cmake ... -DCARLA_PACKAGE_COMPRESSION=pigz   # .tar.gz, parallel gzip (default)
cmake ... -DCARLA_PACKAGE_COMPRESSION=zstd   # .tar.zst, parallel zstd (pzstd)
cmake ... -DCARLA_PACKAGE_COMPRESSION=gzip   # .tar.gz, single-threaded (compatibility)
```

`pigz` and `zstd` both auto-detect CPU cores and parallelize. Install via
`apt install pigz` or `apt install zstd`.

## Troubleshooting

### `agnocastlib` not found

```
Could not find a package configuration file provided by "agnocastlib" …
```

The colcon install for Agnocast is from a different workspace. `prepare`
detects and removes it automatically; rerun `bash RglSetup.sh prepare`.

### `CMakeCache.txt directory is different than the directory …`

A build directory was generated in a different workspace. `prepare` / `build`
detect this automatically and wipe the cache; rerun the same command.

### iceoryx link errors when building CycloneDDS

Fixed upstream in this fork by setting `-DENABLE_SHM=OFF` in CycloneDDS's
ExternalProject — CycloneDDS no longer picks up the system iceoryx built
against libstdc++ while the UE toolchain uses libc++.

## Windows

**TBD** — `RglSetup.sh` is currently a Bash script and targets Linux
(Ubuntu 22.04). A Windows equivalent (e.g. `RglSetup.bat` or PowerShell) is
not yet implemented.
